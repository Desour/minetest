The chat prompt history is stored in the chat_prompt_history.txt file.

The first line in this file is an ASCII text describing the version. It has the
following format:
"minetest chat prompt history version <major>.<minor>.<patch>\n"
Where <major>, <minor> and <patch> are unsigned decimal integers.
If the major number is the same, backwards compatibility is ensured.
If the minor number is also the same, forwards compatibility is also ensured.

Version 1.0.0:
The rest of the file consists of utf-8 lines, separated by the newline character
('\n'). These lines are the chat prompt entries, ordered from oldest to newest.
The characters '\\', '\n' and '\r' in these entries are escaped with the backslash
character ('\\').
