TODO: remove this file

* internal refactors, ie. introduction of "sound groups"
* sounds are loaded lazily (fixes #10603, improves #10316)
* long sounds are streamed (makes #8596 possible)
* time_offset (TODO) (#11865; will be needed at some point anyways for players entering max_hear_distance)
* sound is no longer upside-down (test eg. with hrtf)
* got rid of BS. (gain is still the same everywhere)


TODO:
* implement looped streamed sounds properly
* make time_offset work
* consider #10306 (delay)
* remove sounds that are too far away or finished
* add multithreading
* consider #11617 (sound_play warnings)
* optionally preload starts of sounds
* fix small issues like footstep sounds playing at wrong place or missing vel
* add api or something for setting node size in meters (for speed of sound)
