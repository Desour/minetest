TODO: remove this file

* internal refactors, ie. introduction of "sound groups"
* sounds are loaded lazily (fixes #10603, improves #10316)
* long sounds are streamed (makes #8596/#7867 possible)
* time_offset (TODO) (fixes #11865; will be needed at some point anyways for players entering max_hear_distance)
* sound is no longer upside-down (test eg. with hrtf)
* got rid of BS. (gain is still the same everywhere)
* sound handles are now userdata => method syntax; ids are owned and garbage collected


TODO:
* implement looped streamed sounds properly <- done?
* make time_offset work <- done?
* optionally preload starts of sounds <- no?
* fix small issues like footstep sounds playing at wrong place or missing vel
* add api or something for setting speed of sound in nodes per second, per player
* Add Doppler effect #9172
* Audio: Error opening file for decoding #10979
* minetest.sound_fade [fading in] doesn't work with positional sounds. #6748
* Add warning when stereo sounds are loaded #6622
* No check for missing sounds #4955
