TODO: remove this file

* internal refactors, ie. introduction of "sound groups"
* sounds are loaded lazily (fixes #10603, improves #10316)
* long sounds are streamed (makes #8596/#7867 possible)
* time_offset (TODO?) (fixes #11865; will be needed at some point anyways for players entering max_hear_distance)
* sound is no longer upside-down (test eg. with hrtf)
* got rid of BS. (gain is still the same everywhere)
* sound handles are now userdata => method syntax; ids are owned and garbage collected
* sounds are paused while in pause menu in singleplayer
* shader animation timer is also paused
* warning in errorstream for positional stereo sounds, and don't play (fixes #6622)
* don't spam logs with every file tried in sound-pack (fixes #10979)


TODO:
* implement looped streamed sounds properly <- done?
* make time_offset work <- done? -> test
* fix small issues like footstep sounds playing at wrong place or missing vel
* add api or something for setting speed of sound in nodes per second, per player
* Add Doppler effect #9172
* minetest.sound_fade [fading in] doesn't work with positional sounds. #6748
* testing stuff in devtest

* Get sound duration #12375
* Sound attached to objects do not disappear even when object is removed #11521
* Audio attached to object stops moving when object leaves #8094
* Incomplete Documentation of 'params' sound parameter table, used by minetest.sound_play() #11414
* CSM: playing sounds connected to entities is unimplemented #5389
